# How to use????
Well, you shouldn't yet, because it's still very unfinished and not ready for use whatsoever.
But for when it is...
Set up Node.js, ffmpeg, a MySQL server, make a database and import the structure, update config.json, install the requirements, and finally run ```node .```. That's pretty much it.
# Why is it called clematis?
Because clematis is a type of vine.
